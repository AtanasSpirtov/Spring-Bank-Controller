2.1 You can add or remove account or search account by its id
2.2 You can create transaction, between two accounts or list all transaction of given source account
2.3 You can see results of listing in pdf or excel file

3. When you try to test functionality it will require username and password
Download the database and inside it there is a default user
When security wants username and password type nasko for username and nasko for password
after that you can access every method which you want
